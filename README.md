This is a fork of MCrafterzz mod, who has stated on his curseforge page linked below that anyone who wishes to fork and update the mod may do so freely (with due credit).

Original readme below

# MCrafterzz mod
This mod adds a lot of stuff. More info can be found here: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mcrafterzz-mod

I will no longer update this mod as it needs a total rewrite. You can fork the code or create pull requests. Only requirement is that you credit me for making the original mod.
